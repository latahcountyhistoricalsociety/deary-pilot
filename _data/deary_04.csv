Up the street, partly hidden, is a larger building that at this time or later housed the Olson store, and over it is seen the roof of the depot.  The largest building on the east side of the street, the one with many windows, is the Carlson Hotel.  Above it, just below the railroad crossing, is the newspaper office.
