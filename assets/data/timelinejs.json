Above it are the hardware and the drug store, both characterized by false fronts with peaks.  The flat roof between is part of the drug store.  Next is the box-like shape of the bank.  Up the street, partly hidden, is a larger building that at this time or later housed the Olson store, and over it is seen the roof of the depot.  The largest building on the east side of the street, the one with many windows, is the Carlson Hotel.  Above it, just below the railroad crossing, is the newspaper office.

The buildings above are not seen clearly, but the peaked roofs of both the hardware and drug store can be distinguished, and the bank certainly existed.
